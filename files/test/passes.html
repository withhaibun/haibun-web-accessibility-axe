Government of Canada Digital Standards: Playbook</h1>

    <p class="gc-byline"><strong>From <a href="/en/treasury-board-secretariat.html">Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat</a></strong></p> 
<h2>Improving government services in the Digital Age</h2> 
<p>Our goal is to provide public services to Canadians which are simple to use and trustworthy. The Government of Canada’s Digital Standards form the foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused. They will guide teams in designing digital services in a way that best serves Canadians.</p> 
<p>These digital standards were co-created with the public and key stakeholder groups. They are living standards and they will continue to evolve over time as we better understand the complexities involved in putting them into practice.</p> 
<details> 
 <summary>Playbook context</summary> 
 <p>This guidance is aspirational.&nbsp;It does not reflect how the government currently operates.&nbsp;This&nbsp;guidance outlines&nbsp;ways of working, or behaviours,&nbsp;that&nbsp;align with the Digital Standards&nbsp;(the Standards). While teams are not expected to, at present, strongly align with&nbsp;the following&nbsp;guidance, teams are expected to assess&nbsp;their&nbsp;own and others’&nbsp;behaviours and work&nbsp;to better align&nbsp;with this guidance.</p> 
 <p>Teams are encouraged to note any questions they have, as well as any challenges they encounter while trying to align with the Standards. The Digital Change Sector at TBS is available to help teams&nbsp;with&nbsp;coaching, advice and learning opportunities, including connecting colleagues with experience and expertise on the Digital Standards. What is&nbsp;the&nbsp;story of your journey to align your work to the Government of&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;Digital Standards?</p> 
 <p>These&nbsp;Standards were co-created with the public and key stakeholder groups. They are living standards and will continue to evolve over time as we better understand the complexities involved in putting them into practice.</p> 
 <p>This&nbsp;guidance does not include implementation details, such as specific frameworks of methodologies. For specifics, please refer to existing policy instruments, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603">Policy on Service and Digital</a>.</p> 
 <h4 class="h5">Format</h4> 
 <p>Each standard&nbsp;includes a definition of that standard, followed by lists of aligned and misaligned behaviours. These lists are not exhaustive.</p> 
 <ol> 
  <li>Aligned&nbsp;behaviours: examples of behaviours that align with the&nbsp;Standards&nbsp;</li> 
  <li>Misaligned&nbsp;behaviours: examples of behaviours&nbsp;that&nbsp;go against the spirit of the&nbsp;Standards&nbsp;</li> 
 </ol> 
 <h4 class="h5">Definitions</h4>

<h3 id="ds1">Design with users</h3> 
<p>Research with users to understand their needs and the problems we want to solve. Conduct ongoing testing with users to guide design and development.</p> 
<details> 
 <summary>Guidance: Design with users</summary> 
 <p>Services should&nbsp;be built to address the needs of users,&nbsp;not&nbsp;the&nbsp;internal constraints or complexities of government.&nbsp;To deliver value to users,&nbsp;teams&nbsp;must understand and prioritize&nbsp;users’&nbsp;needs.&nbsp;Everything is a hypothesis until&nbsp;it is&nbsp;tested with the users.<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></p> 
 <p>Teams&nbsp;must&nbsp;validate&nbsp;their&nbsp;hypotheses&nbsp;and&nbsp;assumptions through direct and frequent interactions with those who will be using the services. Users may be members of the public, government employees,&nbsp;or a combination&nbsp;of both.&nbsp;Users will come from diverse backgrounds&nbsp;and&nbsp;vary in location, experience, knowledge,&nbsp;and abilities.&nbsp;Therefore, teams should design&nbsp;services with the needs of all users&nbsp;in mind.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>When designing services,&nbsp;teams&nbsp;must take a holistic approach to service delivery&nbsp;–&nbsp;from each member’s individual contributions to the end goal, as defined by&nbsp;the&nbsp;users.&nbsp;</p> 
 <h4 class="h5">Aligned Behaviours</h4> 
 <ol> 
  <li>Our team uses end-user feedback to establish the requirements of our service(s).</li> 
  <li>Our team has processes or tools in place to incorporate user feedback, including anonymous user feedback, into the design of the service.</li> 
  <li>Our team conducts user research before deciding on how to implement the service. </li> 
  <li>Our team has tested our primary systems with a wide range of users, including users with varying needs and diverse backgrounds.</li> 
  <li>Our team considers user needs and feedback when defining key service metrics.</li>

<h3 id="ds2">Iterate and improve frequently</h3> 
<p>Develop services using agile, iterative and user-centred methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small and scale up.</p> 
<details> 
 <summary>Guidance: Iterate and improve frequently</summary> 
 <p>In contrast to high-risk, long lead, big bang deployments, working services must be in the hands of users as early as possible to get rapid feedback. That feedback is then used to iterate upon to improve the service.<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup></p> 
 <p>Teams set a “north star” to define a clear direction, then begin iterating towards that goal. They must keep in mind that the path is not clear, and unexpected circumstances will require adjustments along the way. By using modern technologies and modern approaches to working, teams can reduce risk by limiting the size of changes and increasing their frequency.</p> 
 <p>Processes should empower teams to deliver value to services as often as possible. But these processes should not increase risk by using documentation in place of demonstrably functioning software, creating prolonged processes. Focus on working software over comprehensive documentation<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup> and remember that perfect is the enemy of good.</p>

<details> 
 <summary>Guidance: Use open standards and solutions</summary> 
 <p>To maintain the trust of Canadians, the government must continually learn and improve by embracing leading practices to simplify access to government services in order to meet the rising expectations of Canadians.</p> 
 <p>The Digital Nations Charter calls for the use of both Open Standards and Open Source. To achieve this, this Digital Standard aligns with the ultimate Digital Vision which reads, “The Government of Canada is an open and service-oriented organization that operates and delivers programs and services to people and businesses in simple, modern and effective ways that are optimized for digital and available anytime, anywhere and from any device.”<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup> By using open source software, and open standards and solutions, the Government of Canada can expand its vendor pool to acquire digital services.</p>

<h3 id="ds5">Address security and privacy risks</h3> 
<p>Take a balanced approach to managing risk by implementing appropriate privacy and security measures. Make security measures frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.</p> 
<details> 
 <summary>Guidance: Address security and privacy risks</summary> 
 <p>Digital services are core to service delivery, and they must securely store and manage Canadians’ information to maintain trust in government services.</p> 
 <p>Teams should consider security and privacy at the very start of working on a given service, in alignment with Iterate and Improve. Teams must consider the implementation of security and privacy controls as part of their daily work. </p> 
 <p>Similarly, the service’s processes should promote and monitor the continuous implementation of security and privacy controls throughout its life cycle. This will increase the security and privacy posture of digital services through automated testing and real-time reporting and monitoring, rather than anecdotal document-heavy manual processes. </p> 
 <p> The security and privacy controls and processes should be frictionless. Teams should ensure that services are designed first and foremost for users, not to satisfy existing legacy government procedures, tooling or processes. </p> 
 <p>Creating frictionless processes and permitting services to be iterated and improved upon quickly will allow the government to respond quickly to security or privacy risks. By responding to these operational needs within hours or minutes rather than months, the government can improve its security and privacy posture.</p> 
 <h4 class="h5">Aligned Behaviours</h4> 
 <ol> 
  <li>Our team considers security and privacy throughout the service design process.</li>

</details> 
<h3 id="ds6">Build in accessibility from the start</h3> 
<p>Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards. Users with distinct needs should be engaged from the outset to ensure what is delivered will work for everyone.</p> 
<details> 
 <summary>Guidance: Build in accessibility from the start</summary> 
 <p>Quality should be built in from the start, so that previously implemented components do not need to be reworked for issues such as accessibility. The faster and earlier issues are found, the less costly they are to fix.<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup></p> 
 <p>Accessibility in Canada is about creating communities, workplaces and services that enable everyone to participate fully in society without barriers. The Government of Canada is committed to taking a proactive and systemic approach to identifying, removing and preventing barriers to accessibility without delay in order to uphold the rights of persons with disabilities under the <em>Canadian Human Rights Act</em>.</p> 
 <p>To meet these commitments, accessibility needs to be considered at every point in the development of the service. Accessibility must be monitored and built into our processes to continually align with accessibility standards. Accessibility should be a constant part of iterating and improving frequently and designing with users, throughout the design of the service. </p> 
 <p>When designing with users, teams should identify a wide variety of users with a wide variety of needs to ensure that accessibility standards are met or exceeded.</p>

<h3 id="ds7">Empower staff to deliver better services</h3> 
<p>Make sure that staff have access to the tools, training and technologies they need. Empower the team to make decisions throughout the design, build and operation of the service.</p> 
<details> 
 <summary>Guidance: Empower staff to deliver better services</summary> 
 <p>To promote innovation and create agility within our organizations, our teams must be empowered. Innovation increasingly flows from the bottom up, rather than from the top down. To benefit from this trend, teams must be empowered.</p> 
 <p>Don’t hire good people to tell them what to do, hire good people to have them tell you what to do.<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup> The government manages large, highly complex and crucially important services for their users. A top-down command and control approach enforces service delivery and design based on the constraints of government,<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> rather than the needs of users or the expertise of those building the services.<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup> Instead of bringing information up to authority, bring authority down to the information.<sup id="fn10-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup> Those best suited to solve a given problem are those closest to the problem.<sup id="fn11-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>11</a></sup></p> 
 <p>By removing decision-making authority from the teams and placing it into complex governance structures, a team’s innovative potential is limited by legacy procedures and processes. To create organizations that are able to iterate and improve frequently, teams must be empowered to make decisions for themselves. </p> 
 <p>Complex architectures that are responsive to the needs of users, including users within the organization, are emergent and are not based on hypotheses that lack the expertise of those closest to the problems needing to be solved.</p>

<h3 id="ds9">Design ethical services</h3> 
<p>Make sure that everyone receives fair treatment. Comply with ethical guidelines in the design and use of systems which automate decision making (such as the use of artificial intelligence).</p> 
<details> 
 <summary>Guidance: Design ethical services</summary> 
 <p>Designing ethical systems means that systems created by the government ensure that everyone receives equitable treatment.</p> 
 <p>Services should address user needs and provide public benefits. In the digital age, the underlying systems that run Canada’s services come to conclusions that can be unclear to both the external users and those managing the systems. The responsible use of automated decision systems includes being open about their use and being able to explain how the systems make decisions. </p> 
 <p>Teams must work to increase the transparency and address potential biases of computational decisions, and to ensure that that decisions made by or supported using these systems are legal, consistent and accurate, and align with the expectations and intents of those managing them. </p> 
 <p>Organizations can ensure that they are designing ethical services through iterative service design where results are continuously monitored against expected and desired outcomes. However, with extensive monitoring solutions, teams must ensure that their services are not enforcing biases, whether conscious or unconscious.</p>

<h3 id="ds10">Collaborate widely</h3> 
<p>Create multidisciplinary teams with the range of skills needed to deliver a common goal. Share and collaborate in the open. Identify and create partnerships which help deliver value to users.</p> 
<details> 
 <summary>Guidance: Collaborate widely</summary> 
 <p>Collaborating widely allows us to learn lessons from others to minimize mistakes and reduce rework by identifying and sharing existing solutions. The problems that government solves are often unique, though they are not unique among governments.</p> 
 <p>Many of the same solutions by the same, or similar, vendors are used throughout the world, or at varying levels of government within different jurisdictions. When designing or implementing a service using tools or systems, teams should identify which other departments, jurisdictions or organizations have used similar technologies to solve similar use cases. In this way, teams will collaborate widely, reduce rework, share solutions and benefit from lessons already learned by others. </p> 
 <p>Using multidisciplinary teams, especially when coupled with the empowerment of teams, makes it easier for the government to deliver modern and innovative services. Through wide collaboration, organizations begin to break down the silos developed over time. </p> 
 <p>Going forward, working across skill sets, using work from others and learning from others’ lessons will encourage the development of modern services that better meet the changing needs of citizens in the digital age.</p>
